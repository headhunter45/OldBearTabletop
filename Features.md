## 1. Canvas Engine & Tactical Battlemap

- **High-Performance 2D Canvas**: Smooth 60 FPS HTML5 Canvas engine optimized for desktop and touch-screen devices without heavy engine overhead.
- **Smart Touch & Trackpad Gestures**:
  - *Standard two-finger trackpad swipe*: Smooth battlemap panning via `this.viewport.pan(-deltaX, -deltaY)`.
  - *Trackpad pinch-to-zoom (`Ctrl`/`Cmd` + scroll)*: Smooth exponential zoom anchored directly at the mouse cursor.
  - *Tuning Constants*: Top-level sensitivity constants in `CanvasEngine.ts`:
    - `TRACKPAD_PAN_SENSITIVITY = 1.0`
    - `TRACKPAD_ZOOM_SENSITIVITY = 0.01`
    - `MOUSE_WHEEL_ZOOM_SENSITIVITY = 0.0015`
- **Multi-Grid System**:
  - **Square & Hexagonal Grids**: Full support for both square grids and pointy-topped hexagonal grids.
  - **Exact Snapping**: Mathematical grid snapping accounts for grid type, custom tile sizes, and fractional pixel offsets.
  - **Grid Alignment Controls**: Configure grid tile counts ($X \times Y$), tile size in pixels, grid line opacity, custom grid color, and pixel offsets ($X, Y$).
  - **Grid Layer Rendering**: Toggleable grid overlay rendered on top of the battlemap artwork, but beneath tokens and props.
  - **Custom Background Color**: Set background fill colors for imageless grid maps or letterboxing margins outside map boundaries.
- **Distance Measurement**:
  - **Dynamic Movement Ruler**: Real-time distance measurement during token dragging with cell counting and speed limit warnings (turns red when exceeding token speed).
  - **Measuring Tape Tool (`M`)**: Dedicated infinite-range distance measurement tape to inspect ranges between any two points without speed restrictions.

---

## 2. Fog of War & Vision

- **Multi-Layer Fog Rendering**:
  - Players see completely opaque fog covering unrevealed areas.
  - GM view displays fog with semi-transparent shading to see what lies ahead.
- **Fog Drawing Tools**:
  - **Fog Hide (`F`)**: Draw rectangular regions to conceal map areas.
  - **Fog Reveal (`R`)**: Draw rectangular regions to reveal concealed areas.
  - **Cover All / Clear All**: Quick GM actions to instantly mask or unmask the entire map.
  - **Automatic Timed Notifications**: Brief, non-intrusive status toasts when covering or clearing fog.

---

## 3. Drawing Tools, Spell Templates & Markers

Accessible via the Drawing Tools sub-menu in the left HUD or number keys (`1` - `6`):

| Key | Tool | Icon | Description |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| **1** | **Laser Pointer** | `Sparkles` | Ephemeral glowing trail that follows cursor movement and smoothly fades out. |
| **2** | **Arrow Marker** | `ArrowUpRight` | Vector pointer with real-time distance badge in feet (`${lengthFt} ft`). |
| **3** | **Target / Crosshair** | `Crosshair` | Draggable target ping with concentric reticle and distance badge; clicking/tapping defaults to minimum 18px size. |
| **4** | **Circle Radius** | `Circle` | Circular spell template with live radius badge in feet (`${radiusFt} ft radius`). |
| **5** | **Rectangle Zone** | `Square` | Rectangular area with live width × height dimensions (`${wFt} ft × ${hFt} ft`). |
| **6** | **Cone / Arc Template** | `Triangle` | Directional spell cone (Burning Hands, Cone of Cold) with dual cone/triangle visualization. |

### Dual Cone / Triangle Visualization (Task #118)
- **Circular Arc**: Rendered in the player's primary highlight color with semi-transparent fill and dashed outline.
- **Flat-Ended Triangle Difference**: The outer corners where a flat-ended triangle cone covers but a circular arc does not are rendered in a distinct, contrasting accent color (`getContrastingAccentColor`).
- **Interactive Spread Handles**: Drag handle dots on the cone's edge to freely adjust the spread angle, plus quick toolbar presets (`53°`, `60°`, `90°`, `120°`, `180°`).

### Persistence System (`📌 Persist` vs. `⚡ Quick Ping`)
- **Quick Ping Mode (`⚡`)**: Drawings and pings automatically fade away after a short duration (2–6 seconds).
- **Persistent Mode (`📌`)**: Drawings remain on the map as durable spell templates, zones, or tactical markers.
- **Shift Inversion**: Holding `Shift` while drawing temporarily inverts the active persistence mode.
- **Drawing Layer Placement**: Persistent markers live on a dedicated drawing layer beneath character tokens and props, preventing tokens from blocking selection.
- **Shape Controls**: Selected persistent shapes display controls for lock/unlock (`🔒`), deletion (`🗑️` / `Delete` / `Backspace`), and rotation/spread presets.

---

## 4. Tokens & Props Management

### Token Management
- **Custom Shapes & Framing**: Clip tokens to circle, square, rounded square, hexagon, or octagon with custom ring color, border width, and integrated pan/zoom cropping controls.
- **Stacking Prevention**: Newly added tokens automatically detect existing tokens and offset slightly to avoid stacking.
- **Overlapping Token Cycle**: Clicking stacked tokens repeatedly cycles selection through each token beneath the cursor.
- **Box Select Tool (`B`)**: Enclose multiple tokens in a drag-box to select, move, assign, or duplicate them as a group. Automatically switches back to Arrow select (`S`) once tokens are chosen.
- **Token Duplication**: Duplicate selected tokens via button or keyboard shortcut (`D` / `Ctrl+D` / `Cmd+D`).
- **Movement Lock (`🔒`)**: Lock tokens or props to prevent accidental dragging during gameplay.
- **Multi-Token Assignment**: GMs can assign control of any token to specific players or assign multiple tokens to one player.
- **Combat Stats**: Inline tracking for Current HP, Max HP, Temporary HP, Armor Class (AC), Speed, and standard 5e Condition Badges (Blinded, Charmed, Concentrating, etc.).

### Props System (Tasks #107, #113, #114, #115)
- **Props as Environmental Objects**: Treat props as furniture, doors, walls, trees, or unkillable NPCs.
- **Fractional Tile Dimensions**: Props support precise decimal tile dimensions (e.g., `1.5 × 3.24` tiles) configurable in the Asset Manager and Settings.
- **Compass Rotation**: Rotate props and tokens using an interactive compass dial or numeric degree input from both asset settings and the bottom toolbar.
- **Streamlined Toolbar**: Cleaned up prop toolbar by omitting HP, temp HP, conditions, and assignment dropdowns.

- **Direct Canvas Drag-and-Drop**: Drag any asset card directly out of the Asset Manager and drop it onto the battlemap to spawn it at the cursor position.
- **"Deploy to Map" Button**: Instant one-click deployment near the viewport center.
- **Batch Drag-and-Drop Import (Task #74)**: Drop multiple images simultaneously to open a batch classifier with bulk actions ("Set all to Tokens", "Set all to Maps", "Set all to Props").
